# Pulse-Retrieval with Jax

Uses Jax to implement various algorithms for pulse-retrieval in ultrafast optics. 
Available methods are FROG, Time-Domain-Ptychography, 2D-SI, VAMPIRE and Chirp-Scans based in material dispersion or pulse-shaping. 
The implemented algorithms include Generalized Projection, Ptychographic Iterative Engine, Common Pulse Retrieval Algorithm, Differential Evolution and more.
