    Calculates the pseudo-newton direction for the Z-error of a FROG measurement.
    The direction is calculated in the frequency domain.

        pulse_t: jnp.array, the current guess
        pulse_t_shifted: jnp.array, the current guess shifted along the time axis

        signal_t: jnp.array, the current signal field
        signal_t_new: jnp.array, the current signal field projected onto the measured intensity
        tau_arr: jnp.array, the time delays
        measurement_info: Pytree, contains measurement data and parameters
        newton_state: Pytree, contains the current state of the hessian calculation, e.g. the previous newton direction
        newton_info: Pytree, contains parameters for the pseudo-newton direction calculation
        full_or_diagonal: str, calculate using the full or diagonal pseudo hessian?
        pulse_or_gate: str, whether the direction is calculated for the pulse or the gate-pulse
